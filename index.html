    <hr />
    <p id="box1">
      An air quality index (AQI) is an approximation of how polluted the air
      currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. As air pollution
      levels rise, so does the AQI, along with the associated public health
      risk.
    </p>
    <p id="box2">
        Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to
        different national air quality standards. The AQI is calculated for major
        air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle
        pollution (also known as particulate matter), carbon monoxide, sulfur
        dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The highest individual pollutant index
        value becomes the overall AQI value, and determines the associated health
        concern and cautionary statement.
    </p>
    <p id="box3">
        The AQI is divided into six categories, each represented by a different
        color. Each category corresponds to a different level of health concern.
        The AQI scale runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater
        the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.
